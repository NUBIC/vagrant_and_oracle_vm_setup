Vagrant and Oracle VM Setup Installer Thingy
===========================
(I'm open to a better name.)

Eventually- A sweet vagrant setup that will let you install a VM with Oracle, CAS, and Coldfusion.

A lot of code borrowed from @hilverd for their awesome work on [a standard vagrant/oracle VM](https://github.com/hilverd/vagrant-ubuntu-oracle-xe "https://github.com/hilverd/vagrant-ubuntu-oracle-xe")
